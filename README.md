- Group Final Project (40%)
- Mid-term (20%)
- End-term (20%)

## GPT Policy

As per the course's GPT policy, you are permitted to use GPT for all assignments and projects, with the exception of midterms and finals. This means that you have the flexibility to utilize GPT's capabilities to help with programming issues. However, it is important to note that GPT should not be used as a substitute for independent thinking or critical analysis, which are essential skills for success in this course. As you move forward in the course, be sure to use GPT responsibly and in conjunction with your own ideas and insights.

## Late Policy:

- Each student will be allotted three free days which can be used to turn in individual assignments late without penalty.
- Once your free days are used up, late homework will be penalized 15% of the overall mark for each 24-hour period. (For instance, homework turned in two days late will receive only 70% credit.)
- If you decide to use your free days on an assignment, remember to indicate the number of free days youâ€™re using on that assignment at the time of submission.

## Exams

There are two exams in this course: a mid-term and an end-term exam. The mid-term exam will cover material from the first half of the course, while the end-term exam will cover the cumulative material with emphasis on the second half. Both exams will be open-book and will test your understanding of the concepts covered in class and in the assignments.
